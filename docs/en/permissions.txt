Downloads Permissions
=====================

There remain three types of permissions available in Downloads.

General:
--------
  - Users need 'READ' access in order to view the user interface to Downloads.
  - Default settings in Zikula give users 'COMMENT' access which is higher, so
    by default, all users can access all downloads.
  - To deny groups access to the entire module do:
    <groupname> | Downloads:: | .* | Overview Access (or no access)
  - You can allow users to upload files by set their access to the entire Downloads module to Add (only add files and edit files) or Delete (full access to all files)

Item Specific:
--------------
  - By default all users have access to all downloads.
  - To deny a group access to a specific item do:
    <groupname> | Downloads::Item | ID#:: | No Access (replace ID# with integer value of download lid)

Category Specific:
------------------
  - By default all users have access to all categories.
  - to deny a group access to a specific category do:
    <groupname> | Downloads::Category | ID#:: | No Access (replace ID# with integet value of category cid)
  - IMPORTANT NOTE: denying access to a parent category DOES NOT deny access to
    it's children! The permissions system is not aware of the tree structure!
